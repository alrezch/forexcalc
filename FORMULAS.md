## üéØ **Lot Size Calculator**

### **Purpose**
Calculate the optimal position size based on risk management principles to ensure no single trade risks more than a predetermined percentage of your account.

### **Core Formula**
```
Position Size = (Account Size √ó Risk Percentage) √∑ (Stop Loss in Pips √ó Pip Value)
Lot Size = Position Size √∑ 100,000
```

### **Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Step 1: Calculate Risk Amount**
```
Risk Amount = Account Size √ó (Risk Percentage √∑ 100)
```

#### **Step 2: Calculate Maximum Loss in Pips**
```
Maximum Loss in Pips = Stop Loss Distance
```

#### **Step 3: Calculate Pip Value**
```
Pip Value = 0.0001 √ó 100,000 √ó Exchange Rate
```

#### **Step 4: Calculate Position Size**
```
Position Size = Risk Amount √∑ (Stop Loss in Pips √ó Pip Value)
```

#### **Step 5: Convert to Lot Size**
```
Lot Size = Position Size √∑ 100,000
```

### **Example Calculation**
```
Account Size: $10,000
Risk Percentage: 2%
Stop Loss: 50 pips
Exchange Rate: 1.2000 (EUR/USD)

Step 1: Risk Amount = $10,000 √ó 0.02 = $200
Step 2: Maximum Loss = 50 pips
Step 3: Pip Value = 0.0001 √ó 100,000 √ó 1.2000 = $12
Step 4: Position Size = $200 √∑ (50 √ó $12) = 0.333 lots
Step 5: Lot Size = 0.333 lots
```

## üí∞ **Margin Calculator**

### **Purpose**
Determine the required margin (collateral) needed to open and maintain a trading position at a given leverage level.

### **Core Formula**
```
Required Margin = (Trade Size √ó Contract Size √ó Price) √∑ Leverage
Margin Percentage = (Required Margin √∑ Account Size) √ó 100
```

### **Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Step 1: Calculate Position Value**
```
Position Value = Trade Size √ó Contract Size √ó Price
```

#### **Step 2: Calculate Required Margin**
```
Required Margin = Position Value √∑ Leverage
```

#### **Step 3: Calculate Margin Percentage**
```
Margin Percentage = (Required Margin √∑ Account Size) √ó 100
```

### **Example Calculation**
```
Trade Size: 1.0 lot (100,000 units)
Contract Size: 100,000 (standard lot)
Price: 1.2000 (EUR/USD)
Leverage: 100:1
Account Size: $10,000

Step 1: Position Value = 100,000 √ó 100,000 √ó 1.2000 = $120,000
Step 2: Required Margin = $120,000 √∑ 100 = $1,200
Step 3: Margin Percentage = ($1,200 √∑ $10,000) √ó 100 = 12%
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Risk-Reward Calculator**

### **Purpose**
Calculate the breakeven win rate needed to achieve profitability with a given risk-reward ratio, and determine the expected value of trading strategies.

### **Core Formula**
```
Breakeven Win Rate = Risk √∑ (Risk + Reward) √ó 100
Expected Value = (Win Rate √ó Reward) - (Loss Rate √ó Risk)
```

### **Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Step 1: Calculate Breakeven Win Rate**
```
Breakeven Win Rate = Risk √∑ (Risk + Reward) √ó 100
```

#### **Step 2: Calculate Expected Value**
```
Expected Value = (Win Rate √ó Reward) - (Loss Rate √ó Risk)
Where: Loss Rate = 100% - Win Rate
```

#### **Step 3: Calculate Profit Factor**
```
Profit Factor = (Win Rate √ó Reward) √∑ (Loss Rate √ó Risk)
```

### **Example Calculation**
```
Risk: 1 (stop loss)
Reward: 2 (take profit)
Target Win Rate: 40%

Step 1: Breakeven Win Rate = 1 √∑ (1 + 2) √ó 100 = 33.33%
Step 2: Expected Value = (0.40 √ó 2) - (0.60 √ó 1) = 0.80 - 0.60 = +0.20
Step 3: Profit Factor = (0.40 √ó 2) √∑ (0.60 √ó 1) = 0.80 √∑ 0.60 = 1.33
```

## üìè **Pip Calculator**

### **Purpose**
Calculate the monetary value of a single pip movement for different trade sizes and currency pairs.

### **Core Formula**
```
Pip Value = (0.0001 √ó Trade Size √ó Exchange Rate) √∑ Base Currency Rate
Standard Lot Pip Value = 0.0001 √ó 100,000 √ó Exchange Rate
```

### **Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Step 1: Calculate Raw Pip Value**
```
Raw Pip Value = 0.0001 √ó Trade Size √ó Exchange Rate
```

#### **Step 2: Adjust for Base Currency**
```
Pip Value = Raw Pip Value √∑ Base Currency Rate
```

#### **Step 3: Convert to Deposit Currency**
```
Pip Value in Deposit Currency = Pip Value √ó Deposit Currency Rate
```

### **Example Calculation**
```
Trade Size: 0.1 lot (10,000 units)
Currency Pair: EUR/USD
Exchange Rate: 1.2000
Base Currency: USD

Step 1: Raw Pip Value = 0.0001 √ó 10,000 √ó 1.2000 = $1.20
Step 2: Pip Value = $1.20 √∑ 1 = $1.20
Step 3: Final Pip Value = $1.20
```

### **Special Cases**

#### **JPY Pairs (e.g., USD/JPY)**
```
Pip Value = (0.01 √ó Trade Size √ó Exchange Rate) √∑ Base Currency Rate
```

#### **Cross Currency Pairs**

## üìà **Profit & Loss Calculator**

### **Purpose**
Calculate the potential profit or loss from a trade based on entry and exit prices, trade size, and exchange rates.

### **Core Formula**
```
P&L = (Close Price - Open Price) √ó Trade Size √ó Exchange Rate
P&L in Pips = Close Price - Open Price (in pip units)
```

### **Detailed Breakdown**

#### **Step 1: Calculate Price Difference**
```
Price Difference = Close Price - Open Price
```

#### **Step 2: Calculate Raw P&L**
```
Raw P&L = Price Difference √ó Trade Size
```

#### **Step 3: Convert to Deposit Currency**
```
P&L = Raw P&L √ó Exchange Rate
```

#### **Step 4: Calculate P&L in Pips**
```
P&L in Pips = Price Difference √∑ 0.0001 (for 4-decimal pairs)
P&L in Pips = Price Difference √∑ 0.01 (for JPY pairs)
```

### **Example Calculation**
```
Open Price: 1.2000
Close Price: 1.2050
Trade Size: 1.0 lot (100,000 units)
Currency Pair: EUR/USD

Step 1: Price Difference = 1.2050 - 1.2000 = 0.0050
Step 2: Raw P&L = 0.0050 √ó 100,000 = 500
Step 3: P&L = 500 √ó 1 = $500

## üìã **Practical Examples**

### **Example 1: Conservative Risk Management**
```
Account: $25,000
Risk per Trade: 1%
Stop Loss: 30 pips
Currency: EUR/USD at 1.2000

Calculation:
Risk Amount = $25,000 √ó 0.01 = $250
Pip Value = 0.0001 √ó 100,000 √ó 1.2000 = $12
Position Size = $250 √∑ (30 √ó $12) = 0.694 lots
Lot Size = 0.694 lots
```

### **Example 2: Aggressive Position Sizing**
```
Account: $10,000
Risk per Trade: 3%
Stop Loss: 100 pips
Currency: GBP/USD at 1.3000

Calculation:
Risk Amount = $10,000 √ó 0.03 = $300
Pip Value = 0.0001 √ó 100,000 √ó 1.3000 = $13
Position Size = $300 √∑ (100 √ó $13) = 0.231 lots
Lot Size = 0.231 lots
```

### **Example 3: Margin Calculation**
```
Trade Size: 2.0 lots
Currency: USD/JPY at 110.00
Leverage: 50:1
Account: $50,000

Calculation:
Position Value = 200,000 √ó 110.00 = ¬•22,000,000
Required Margin = ¬•22,000,000 √∑ 50 = ¬•440,000
Margin in USD = ¬•440,000 √∑ 110.00 = $4,000
Margin Percentage = ($4,000 √∑ $50,000) √ó 100 = 8%
```

### **Professional Recommendations**
- **Risk Management**: Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
- **Position Sizing**: Use calculated lot sizes as maximums
- **Diversification**: Spread risk across multiple positions
- **Regular Review**: Monitor and adjust risk parameters
